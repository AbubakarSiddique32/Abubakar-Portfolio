      <p>
        I'm a passionate Front-End Web Developer with a strong focus on creating
        visually appealing, responsive, and high-performance websites. With
        experience in building modern user interfaces using technologies like
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I specialize in turning ideas into
        functional, interactive digital experiences. I also integrate essential
        tools like Klaviyo for email automation, optimize websites for mobile
        performance, and ensure seamless plugin integrations. Whether you're a
        brand looking to stand out or a business aiming for better user
        engagement, I bring clean code, creative thinking, and a user-first
        approach to every project.
