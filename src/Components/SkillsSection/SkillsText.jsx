        As a web developer, I specialize in building responsive and dynamic
        websites that provide seamless user experiences. With a strong
        foundation in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I
        have experience using modern frameworks like React to create interactive
        and efficient web applications. I also focus on building visually
        appealing and functional designs using tools like BootStrap, Tailwind
        CSS and custom CSS. Additionally, I have experience with version control
        using Git and deploying applications to various platforms, ensuring that
        everything I build is both scalable and maintainable.
